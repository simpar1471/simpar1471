- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @simpar1471, an undergrad at the University of Edinburgh currently working on patterns of palmitoylation in the mouse anterior lobe.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in bioinformatics, mainly, but I enjoy scripting for silly reasons too. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to integrate bits (very small portions) of Python with R, and working on how best to structure projects for both readability and utility.
