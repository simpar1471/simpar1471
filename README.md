- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @simpar1471. I currently work with Dr Sophie Eastwood at the MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Aging at UCL. I previously completed my bachelor's at the University of Edinburgh, followed by the Cancer Informatics MRes course at Imperial College London.
- ðŸ‘€ At the moment I script for biostatistical purposes, but enjoy coding for my own enjoyment too.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on how best to integrate Quarto into my workflows.
