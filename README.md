- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @simpar1471, a University of Edinburgh graduate who recently completed the Cancer Informatics MRes course at Imperial College London. I currently work with Dr Eric Ohuma at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
- ðŸ‘€ I mainly script for bioinformatics-related purposes, but enjoy coding for my own enjoyment too.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on how best to structure projects for both readability and utility.
