- 👋 Hi, I’m @simpar1471. I currently work with Dr Sophie Eastwood at the MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Aging at UCL. I previously completed my bachelor's at the University of Edinburgh, followed by the Cancer Informatics MRes course at Imperial College London.
- 🤔 My current work involves generating drug usage information using electronic health records.
- 🤓 I've previously worked on projects concerning fetal and child growth (e.g. [gigs](https://www.github.com/lshtm-gigs/gigs/)), and have written a few R packages which are hosted on GitHub.
- 🖥️ I'm happy to work with R, Git, or LaTeX, but will also work with Python and Stata.
- 🌱 Outside of specific projects, I’m currently working on how best to integrate Quarto into my workflows.
